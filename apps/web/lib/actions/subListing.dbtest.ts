/**
 * THE IMPORTER, EXECUTED RATHER THAN READ.
 *
 * `lib/sub-listing/proposedOnlyCensus.test.ts` reads the write site and asserts
 * it never mentions CONFIRMED or stamps a reviewer. That is a real guard and it
 * catches the refactor — but it is a guard on the TEXT of the function, and an
 * adversarial review of this feature correctly marked the whole of the action's
 * behaviour as "read from code, not executed". Tenant scoping, the in-import
 * dedupe, the staleness refusal and the PROPOSED-only promise were all argued
 * rather than demonstrated.
 *
 * This demonstrates them. The assertions that matter are the ones a source
 * census structurally cannot make:
 *
 *   - rows land `PROPOSED` with `reviewedAt` and `reviewedByUserId` NULL, and
 *     `qualify` therefore still reads THIN on a lead the importer just filled —
 *     the band must not move until a person confirms, or it measures how much
 *     reading happened rather than what anybody knows;
 *   - attaching to another company's lead is refused, by a re-read INSIDE the
 *     transaction rather than by the candidate list the screen was rendered
 *     from;
 *   - the same subcontractor on two rows of one listing becomes ONE lead. A
 *     §4104 listing names a sub once per PORTION OF WORK, so a sub doing framing
 *     and plaster appears twice on one page, and `leadCandidatesFor` only ever
 *     sees leads that existed BEFORE the import;
 *   - a selection the server's own parse does not contain is refused whole,
 *     not reconciled.
 *
 * Line numbers are derived by parsing the fixture here rather than counted by
 * hand, so a fixture edit cannot silently point the assertions at other rows.

/**
 * `isProvaOperator` is part of the mock ON PURPOSE and was missing at first:
 * `assertSalesAccess` reads it off the CONTEXT, not off the row, so six tests
 * failed with "Not found" while the company in the database had the flag set.
 * The guard was working; the harness was lying to it.
